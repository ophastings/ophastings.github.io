<blockquote><span>Using the 2006-2008-2010 GSS panel, we look at how changing church attendance, family income, and marital status may help explain why Americans were less happy in 2010 than 2006. We find significant effects from changing family income-especially in response to job loss-and changes in marital status. </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span>Though most research finds women are more religious than men, we find the opposite among former White House Fellows. Based on our survey and in-depth interviews, we suggest aspiring women may not benefit from religion the same way men do, that religious institutions often do not provide as much support for elite women as elite men, and that scholars need finer-grained measures of professional accomplishment and social standing to understand gender differences in religion.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span>We assess the reliability and stability on 265 core items in the General Social Survey using the Heise (1969) model. Thirty percent have reliability coefficients greater than 0.85, and 32% are between 0.7 and 0.85 (which we think is pretty good). Some instability can be explained by the economic recession of 2007-09 and the election of Obama in 2008.</span></blockquote>
