<p>Hastings, Orestes P. 2016. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16000272">"Not a Lonely Crowd? Social Connectedness, 
Religious Service Attendance, and the Spiritual But Not Religious."</a> <i>Social Science Research</i>, in press. </p>
<blockquote><span>Using the 2006–2014 General Social Survey and 2006–2012 Portraits of American Life Study, 
I find that on three dimensions of social connectedness: social interaction frequency, core discussion network size, 
and number of close ties, that religious service attenders are more connected than religious non-attenders and 
then either spiritual nor religious, but there are few differences between attenders and the spiritual but not religious.
Difference-in-differences and fixed-effects models show little evidence that switches between categories are associated
with changes in connectedness, and additional models show that prior social connectedness explains only a small amount
of future switches. This paper challenges assumptions that the non-religious are a homogenous group lacking the benefits
provided though the social networks of religious congregations and has implications for research on what it means to be 
spiritual, measuring religion and spirituality, and understanding the role of formal organizations in social life.

Hastings. 2015. <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-015-0437-7">"Socioeconomic Variation in the Effect of Economic Conditions on Marriage and Nonmarital Fertility in the United States: Evidence From the Great Recession."</a> <i>Demography</i> 52(6): 1893-1915.
<blockquote><span>The United States has become increasingly characterized by stark class divides in family structure. 
Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth outside of marriage.
Recent work in demography and cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high 
economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions.
We use variation in the severity of the Great Recession between years and across states to examine how exposure to worse
state-level economic conditions is related to poor women’s likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012.
We find that worse economic conditions reduced both married <i>and</i> fertility for unmarried women of low socioeconomic status (SES), 
which suggests that economic concerns are connected to fertility decisions for low-SES unmarried women.

<blockquote><span>Using the 2006-2008-2010 GSS panel, we look at how changing church attendance, family income, and marital status may help explain why Americans were less happy in 2010 than 2006. We find significant effects from changing family income-especially in response to job loss-and changes in marital status. </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span>Though most research finds women are more religious than men, we find the opposite among former White House Fellows. Based on our survey and in-depth interviews, we suggest aspiring women may not benefit from religion the same way men do, that religious institutions often do not provide as much support for elite women as elite men, and that scholars need finer-grained measures of professional accomplishment and social standing to understand gender differences in religion.</span></blockquote>

Chicago: NORC. </p>
<blockquote><span>We assess the reliability and stability on 265 core items in the General Social Survey using the Heise (1969) model. Thirty percent have reliability coefficients greater than 0.85, and 32% are between 0.7 and 0.85 (which we think is pretty good). Some instability can be explained by the economic recession of 2007-09 and the election of Obama in 2008.</span></blockquote>
