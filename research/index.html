<blockquote><span> Using the 2006-2014 General Social Survey and 2006-2012 Portraits of American Life Study,
I find for three dimensions of social connectedness: social interaction frequency, core discussion network size,
and number of close ties, that religious service attenders are more connected than religious 
non-attenders and those who are neither spiritual nor religious, but there are few differences 
between attenders and the spiritual but not religious. Difference-in-differences and fixed-effects
models show little evidence that switches between categories are associated with changes in connectedness,
and additional models show that prior social connectedness explains only a small amount of future switches.
This paper challenges assumptions that the non-religious are a homogenous group lacking the benefits provided 
though the social networks of religious congregations and has implications for research on what it means to
be spiritual, measuring religion and spirituality, and understanding the role of formal organizations in social life.

<blockquote><span> The United States has become increasingly characterized by stark class divides in family structure. 
Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth 
outside of marriage. Recent theoretical and qualitative work at the intersection of demography and 
cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high, nearly unattainable,
economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions. 
We use the events of the Great Recession, leveraging variation in the severity of the crisis between years and across states,
to examine how exposure to worse state-level economic conditions is related to poor women’s likelihood of marriage and of
having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012. In accord with theory, we find that women of low socioeconomic status (SES)
exposed to worse economic conditions are indeed somewhat less likely to marry. However, we also find that unmarried low-SES
women exposed to worse economic conditions significantly reduce their fertility; economic standing is not disconnected from
nonmarital fertility. Our results suggest that economic concerns were connected to fertility decisions for low-SES
unmarried women during the Great Recession.

<blockquote><span>Using the 2006-2008-2010 GSS panel, we look at how changing church attendance, family income, and marital status may help explain why Americans were less happy in 2010 than 2006. We find significant effects from changing family income-especially in response to job loss-and changes in marital status. </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span>Though most research finds women are more religious than men, we find the opposite among former White House Fellows. Based on our survey and in-depth interviews, we suggest aspiring women may not benefit from religion the same way men do, that religious institutions often do not provide as much support for elite women as elite men, and that scholars need finer-grained measures of professional accomplishment and social standing to understand gender differences in religion.</span></blockquote>

Chicago: NORC. </p>
<blockquote><span>We assess the reliability and stability on 265 core items in the General Social Survey using the Heise (1969) model. Thirty percent have reliability coefficients greater than 0.85, and 32% are between 0.7 and 0.85 (which we think is pretty good). Some instability can be explained by the economic recession of 2007-09 and the election of Obama in 2008.</span></blockquote>
