<p><b>Dissertation</b><p>

<p>Despite claims that growing economic inequality—such as that experienced in the United States over the past forty years—has resulted in adverse consequences, prior work has yet to achieve meaningful consensus on the effects of the level of inequality across an array of important outcomes. Scholars have identified part of the problem as an insufficient attention to the specific mechanisms by which inequality might matter, an insight that animates each of my research projects. </p>

<p>My dissertation research is at the intersection of stratification, economic sociology, and social psychology. In three papers I provide new insight into how income inequality affects people through the comparisons they make to others. First, I examine three effects of rising income inequality that are frequently assumed to be key mediators between income inequality and critical social problems, yet are rarely examined directly. I analyze each outcome by linking restricted-access nationally representative survey data to state-level administrative data. My analysis obtains better casual estimates by controlling for state fixed effects and accounting for a number of wide range of potential individual and contextual-level confounders, and pays attention to how the effects of the level of inequality vary by one’s place on the income distribution. I show that higher inequality increases feelings of relative deprivation (especially for those in the middle of the income distribution), reduces trust in others, and reduces optimism for upward economic mobility.</p>

<p>Scholars have long recognized that social comparisons depend upon a “reference group,” but there is little consensus about who people compare themselves with.  In the second dissertation paper I examine this important theoretical and empirical question in the context of social comparisons of income. I examine the often-noted gap between where Americans perceive they stand relative to others on the income distribution and they actually are. I find that reference groups—defined by geography (from neighborhoods to states) and sociodemographic criteria (occupation, education, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort)—affect perceived relative income in patterned ways: higher median incomes of large groups and those with strong status hierarchies increase individuals’ perceptions of their relative income, while higher median incomes of small groups and those with weak status hierarchies decrease it. These results have implications for how reference groups are used in research on income inequality, neighborhood effects, and residential segregation.</p>

<p>Finally, my third dissertation paper further explores how income inequality shapes people’s beliefs about their opportunities and expectations for future social mobility. Building on existing research showing what Americans believe about inequality largely depends on what they believe about mobility, I advance our understanding in two ways: I consider how one’s economic optimism is shaped by both the level and rate of change in inequality, and I employ an online experiment that manipulates knowledge about income inequality.</p>

Religious Service Attendance, and the Spiritual But Not Religious."</a> <i>Social Science Research</i> 57:63-79. </p>
<blockquote><span>I explore concerns that the rise of the religiously unaffiliated is a cause of declining 
social connectedness among Americans. I show that religious service attenders are more 
socially connected than religious non-attenders and the neither spiritual nor religious,
but there are few differences between attenders and the spiritual but not religious.
Using panel data, I show there is little evidence that switches between categories 
are associated with changes in connectedness, and that prior social connectedness 
explains only a small portion of future switches. These results have important 
implications for research on what it means to be spiritual, measuring religion
and spirituality, and understanding the role of formal organizations in social life.

<blockquote><span>The United States has become increasingly characterized by stark class divides in family structure. 
Poor women are less likely to marry than their more affluent counterparts but are far more likely to have a birth outside of marriage.
Recent work in demography and cultural sociology suggests that these patterns are generated because poor women have high 
economic standards for marriage but make a much weaker connection between economic standing and fertility decisions.
We use variation in the severity of the Great Recession between years and across states to examine how exposure to worse
state-level economic conditions is related to poor women’s likelihood of marriage and of having a nonmarital birth between 2008 and 2012.
We find that worse economic conditions reduced both marriage <i>and</i> fertility rates for unmarried women of low socioeconomic status (SES). 
This suggests economic concerns are connected to fertility decisions for low-SES unmarried women.

<blockquote><span>Though most research finds women are more religious than men, we find the opposite among former White House Fellows. Based on our survey and in-depth interviews, we think aspiring women may not benefit from religion the same way men do, that religious institutions often do not provide as much support for elite women as elite men, and that scholars need finer-grained measures of professional accomplishment and social standing to understand gender differences in religion.</span></blockquote>

Thirty percent have reliability coefficients greater than 0.85, and 32% are between 0.7 and 0.85 (which we think is pretty good). Some instability can be explained by the economic recession of 2007-09 and the election of Obama in 2008.</span></blockquote>
