	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Pat, a <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/orestes-pat-hastings">PhD 
		candidate in Sociology</a> at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

	<p>I am currently exploring how attitudes and behaviors are shaped by contextual economic factors such as income inequality,
	average income, and unemployment. More generally, I am interested in using surveys, experiments, and administrative data to 
	study stratification, inequality, social change, economy &amp society, culture, and religion.</p>
