	<p class="lead"> Hi, I'm Pat, a <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/orestes-pat-hastings">PhD 
		candidate in Sociology</a> at the University of California, Berkeley. 
		In Fall 2017, I will join <a href="http://sociology.colostate.edu/">Colorado State University</a> as an Assistant Professor of Sociology.</p>

	<p> 
	I use surveys, experiments, and administrative data to do research in 
	stratification, inequality, economic sociology, social psychology, social demography, religion &amp spirituality, and quantitative methods.
	I am especially interested in how economic inequality shapes attitudes and behaviors.
