	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Pat, a <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/orestes-pat-hastings">PhD 
		candidate in Sociology</a> at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

	<p>I primarily study how economic inequality shapes attitudes and behaviors. More generally, 
	I use surveys, experiments, and administrative data to do research in 
	stratification, inequality, economic sociology, social psychology, demography, culture, religion &amp spirituality, and quantitative methods.</p>
