	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm Pat, a <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/orestes-pat-hastings">PhD 
		candidate in Sociology</a> at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

	<p>My research explores how people's attitudes and behaviors are shaped by the economic contextual factors 
	(e.g., income inequality or unemployment) they live in. I am more generally interested in using surveys and 
	administrative data to study stratification, inequality, culture, religion, and organizations.</p>
