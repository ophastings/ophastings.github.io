<p>I have been a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI) for Berkeley Sociology's two-semester 
	graduate quantitative methods course and for two undergraduate classes (“Social Inequality” and “Research Methods”). 
	If you are interested in content from those, please <a href="../contact">contact me</a>.</p>


<p> I have been a mentor for the <a href="http://www.populationsciences.berkeley.edu/population-center/programs/cal-adar">Cal-ADAR program (Advancing Diversity in Aging Research)</a>,
 a program supported by the National Institutes of Aging to give underrepresented students undergraduate research experience in demography. For more information or to apply, visit the program's
 <a href= "http://www.populationsciences.berkeley.edu/population-center/programs/cal-adar">website</a>.

<p> I have been a consultant and workshop instructor for UC Berkeley’s <a href= "http://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a>, 
a center for data intensive social science. <a href="../stataintensive">Here</a> are files from my one of my Stata Intensives.
