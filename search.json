    "text": "I'm an Associate Professor of Sociology at Colorado State University. My research lies broadly at the intersection of inequality, economic sociology, and family demography. Most of my current work focuses on using quantitative and computational methods to understand the socioeconomic correlates of parenting and their implications for children’s lives. But my interests have been quite varied, and I've also published articles on income inequality, happiness, religion, the spiritul but not religious, gender, social capital, survey methodology, and even  physics  (a very long time ago). I not only study parenting but attempt to practice it as a dad to three boys, and, when possible, I enjoy running (sometimes  really, really far), climbing, biking, and skiing. \n    \n    \n    Here is my CV."

    "text": "Updates\n\nSabbatical! This fall I am visiting the Centre for Research on Social Inequalities, Sciences Po and Nuffield College, University of Oxford (Oct 2024)\nHow can we measure the cultural logics of parenting using computational text analysis? We show one approach in a new paper in Social Science Research (with Luca Maria Pesando). We find two key dimensions of parenting logics: (1) assertive vs negotiated parenting, and (2) pedagogic vs pragmatic parenting. (Sept 2024)\nNew paper! There are larger class gaps in parental investments during the summer and among families with younger children. Joe LaBriola and I examine this (and more) in “The Summer Parental Investment Gap? Socioeconomic Gaps in the Seasonality of Parental Expenditures and Time with School-age Children” that is published in Research in Social Stratification and Mobility. (Nov 2023)\nTenured and promoted to Associate Professor! (July 2023)\nMy new paper “Linking Individual and Collective Social Capital: Operationalization, Association, and Sociodemographic Heterogeneity” with Shawna Bendeck is now published in Sociological Spectrum. (Feb 2023)\nMy new data visualization article “Parental Investments of Money for White, Black, and Hispanic Children in the United States” is now published in Socius. (June 2022)\nReceived a Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science (SICSS) research grant from the Social Science Research Council to support my project “What’s a Parent to do? Measuring Parenting Approaches in the US with Topic Modeling for Short Texts” with Luca Maria Pesando. (March 2022)\nNew article! “Family Structure and Inequalities in Parents’ Financial Investments in Children” with Daniel Schneider is in the Journal of Marriage and Family. We previously summarized some of this research in The Conversation (May 2021)\nMy new article “Happiness in Hard Times: Does Religion Buffer the Negative Effect of Unemployment on Happiness?” with Kassandra Roeser has now been published in Social Forces. (Nov 2020)\nThe Urban Institute’s Housing Matters posted a summary of my recently published research with Adam Goldstein on how school quality shapes how much parent’s are willing to spend on housing.
