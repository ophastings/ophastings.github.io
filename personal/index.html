<p>I grew up near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Lago+Vista,+TX&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Lago+Vista,+TX&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=wqvPTJ7LAYPSsAOcoan4AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ8gEwAA">Austin, Texas.</a> 
I attended college at <a title="http://www.rice.edu/" href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a> where I studied <a href="http://www.physics.rice.edu/">physics</a> and <a href="http://math.rice.edu/">math</a>.
During that time I managed to co-author
a <a href="http://www.nist.gov/manuscript-publication-search.cfm?pub_id=842476">paper</a> with
a <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2012/wineland-facts.html">Nobel Laureate</a>
and get a defined <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erdős number.</a> (It's four.
You may not care, but <a title="http://xkcd.com/599/" href="http://xkcd.com/599/">some people do.</a> 
Feel free to publish with me if you would like an Erdős number of five. If you have an Erdős number of two, let's talk...).
</p>

<p>Currently I study the social world as a <a href="http://sociology.berkeley.edu/graduate-student/orestes-pat-hastings">sociology PhD student</a> at the University of California, Berkeley.
I enjoy running and climbing, which I sometimes track on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/pat_hastings">Strava</a> and <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/u/pat-h//107979348?action=ticks&">Mountain Project.</a>
