I grew up near <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Lago+Vista,+TX&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Lago+Vista,+TX&amp;gl=us&amp;ei=wqvPTJ7LAYPSsAOcoan4AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=image&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBsQ8gEwAA">Austin, Texas.</a> 
I attended college at <a title="http://www.rice.edu/" href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a> where I studied <a href="http://www.physics.rice.edu/">physics</a> and <a href="http://math.rice.edu/">math</a>. Eventually, I traded studying the physical world for studying the social world. 
Currently I am a sociology PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. The specifics are on my <a href="../research">research page</a>.

I am a husband to Michelle and father to Patterson and Gideon. I enjoy running and climbing, which I sporadically track on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/pat_hastings">Strava</a> and <a href="http://www.mountainproject.com/u/pat-h//107979348?action=ticks&">Mountain Project.</a>

I have profiles on 	<a href="https://twitter.com/ophastings">Twitter</a>, 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ophastings">Facebook</a>, and 
	<a href="https://google.com/+PatHastings">Google+</a>.
