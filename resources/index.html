<p>This page is Under Construction</p>

<p> I have also taught several <a title="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/pat-hastings" href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/pat-hastings">workshops</a> 
  for <a href = "http://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a> on data management, statistics, and graphics in Stata. I plan to post a cleaned version of my
  notes for these trainins on this site, but in the mean time if you attended one of those workshops and would like the notes,
  please <a href="contact">contact me</a>.</p>

I use Stata a great deal for my work. I have found these pages useful as general Stata resources:
<ul class="list-unstyled">
			 <li><a title="http://data.princeton.edu/stata/" href="http://data.princeton.edu/stata/">good intro</a></li>
			 <li><a title="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/" href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/"> more advanced</a></li>
			 <li><a title="http://www.stata.com/statalist/" href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/">Stata Forum</a></li>
</ul>

I have also found a couple of user-written programs to be especially helpful:
  <a href="http://repec.org/bocode/e/estout/">estout</a>
  <a href="http://michaelstepner.com/binscatter/">binscatter</a>
