<b><p>Teaching</p></b>
<p> <b><a href="../stataintensive">Go here</a> for the files of my January 2015 Stata Intensive.</b> I have taught several workshops
	for <a href = "http://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/pat-hastings">D-Lab</a> on data management, statistics, and graphics 
	in Stata. Previously I was also a data and statistical consultant for D-Lab. 
</p>
	
<p> I have also been the Graduate Student Instructor for Berkeley Sociology's two-semester 
	graduate statistics course (2012-2013) and one-semester undergraduate methods course (2011).
	If you are interested in content from those, please <a href="../contact">contact me</a>.
</p>

<b><p>Tools</p></b>
I use Stata a great deal for my work. I have found these resources especially useful:
<ul>
	<li>a good intro <a title="http://data.princeton.edu/stata/" href="http://data.princeton.edu/stata/">tutorial</a> from German Rodriguez</li>
	<li>the <a title="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/" href="http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/">UCLA Statistical Consulting Group</a></li>
	<li>the <a title="http://www.stata.com/statalist/" href="http://www.stata.com/statalist/">Stata forum</a></li>
	<li>some user-written Stata programs</li>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://repec.org/bocode/e/estout/">estout</a> (for great tables) </li>
		<li><a href="http://michaelstepner.com/binscatter/">binscatter</a> (for binned scatterplots)</li>
		<li>grc1leg (for combining multiple graphs with one legend)</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>In addition to Stata, I enjoy working with LaTeX, Evernote, Omnifocus, a Macbook Pro, and Philz Coffee.</p>
